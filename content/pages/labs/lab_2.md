Lab 2 Description ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lab2))

The dynamics of a spinning shaft and the effects of adding inertia and viscous fluid damping are examined in this lab. Figure 1 shows the actual apparatus.

The drawing in figure 2 depicts the most important parts. The shaft and flywheel are modeled as an equivalent rotary inertia.

A brass ring can be added to increase the inertia, as shown in figure 3.

The axial position constraint is provided by a ball bearing. This ball bearing is attached to the end of the shaft and rotates on a fixed hardened flat (figure 4). Damping is created by filling with honey the annular space between the end of the shaft and a clear tube. The height of the honey can be changed via the syringe shown in figure 1. The fluid damping can be modeled as an equivalent rotary damper that is linearly proportional to the height L of the viscous fluid.

Figure 5 shows the idealization of this first-order system. We have chosen honey as the viscous fluid to attain time constants on the order of 1 second with relatively loose geometric constraints. Furthermore, honey is environmentally safe and can be cleaned up with water.

Figure 6 shows how the animation is being read from the screen. The data can be read by sticking a transparent angle sheet on the screen.

By reading every frame and processing the data (with for example MATLAB®) a plot of the angle versus time can be constructed (figure 7).

Clearly, we could automate this data collection by using for example an optical encoder or a tachometer. The reason for using a camera is to make the data acquisition more intuitive for the students in the early labs. To see an example of such a video capture click on the video button:

Materials and Notes: Practical Info and Comments
------------------------------------------------

*   Air bearings New Way®, Each bearing consists of two parts:  
    (1) S301901 - 3/4" I.D. air bushing  
    (2) S8019P01 - pillow block housing for the air bushings  
    Prices for the New Way® bearings can be found at: [New Way® Air Bearings](http://www.newwayairbearings.com/). If you are looking for other air bearing types, note that the alignment is a major concern. An advantage of this type of air bearings is that the o-rings allow for some flexibility. Be careful not to damage the o-rings when assembling. Use alcohol as a lubricant when assembling the air bearings. A collar on the shaft is used to disable lifting the shaft to much to avoid honey coming into the bearings. However, it is possible to thoroughly clean the honey out of the bearings with alcohol while they are attached to an air supply. The part of the shaft that goes into the air bearing should be precision ground and unscratched for optimal results. Do not move the shaft inside the bearings when the bearings are not hooked up to air supply to prevent unnecessary scratching of the bearings and shaft.

*   Collar Whittet Higgins aluminum split-collar clamps: partnumber SC-12A (split collar-size, aluminum). We use 3/4" inner diameter to match the shaft and air bearings. Look at their Web site at [Whittet-higgins company](http://www.whittet-higgins.com/) go to 'Collars'>'SC-A', order from [Kaman Industrial Tech](http://www.kamandirect.com/) (781/935-7590).

*   Honey We have chosen honey as the viscous fluid to attain time constants on the order of 1 second with relatively loose geometric constraints. Furthermore, honey is environmentally safe and can be cleaned up with water. However, honey cristallizes after being exposed to open air for a few days. It is therefore recommended to change the honey when it becomes too thick. Be sure that the honey does not get into the air bearings. For instance use a collar on the shaft to make sure the shaft can not be lifted too far up. If the shaft is not concentric with the look-through tube that holds the honey, the honey will not be distributed evenly across its circumference. This nonideal behavior is hard to model.
